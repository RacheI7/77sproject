Multiple Instance Learning Based On MNIST
================================================


Requirement
--------
python 3.7
pytorch 1.10.1
torchvision 0.11.2


Content
--------
This project trains a model to classify digit'7' based on multiple instance learning and CNN.
It loads data from mil and transform them to right format.
Then training dataset will be sent into CNN to optimize parameters.
Test validation will be conduct every 50 steps.
