Using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta(RK4) method to solve Enzyme Kinetic Equations
=================================================================================


Requirement
--------
python 3.7


Content
--------
This project use RK4 method to solve enzyme kinetic equations.
Hand-write math solutions and programming results are recorded in the pdf file''solution to Q2.pdf'.
You can also set your own step width and reaction time in the code.
Two diagrams and a table will be obtained after running.
